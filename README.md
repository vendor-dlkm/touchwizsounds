# TouchWiz Sounds
This is a Magisk module with the intent to replace almost every sound from the default AOSP ones to the ones from TouchWiz, heard from the Galaxy S6 and A5(2016).
# Requirements
- Magisk v20.4+ (only tested with v28)
- Android... I really don't know (only tested with Android 14 (LOS 21))
